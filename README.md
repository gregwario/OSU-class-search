## Description
Wondering how hard your next class might be? Did other students think CS162 was a bloodbath, too? This app can tell you!

The OSU eCampus subreddit collects course reviews from real students into this spreadsheet, but the spreadsheet is large and hard to navigate. This app lets you view individual course reviews and aggregates difficulty ratings and time spent.

This project was generated with the Ruby on Rails 5.2

This project was started entirely by Naohito Muraoka, and was later augmented with contributions from Nathan Stauffer and Greg Doolittle. The site uses Ruby on Rails with HTML, CSS, Javascript. We are looking for other developers to work to improve this project, as well as other projects using Ruby on Rails.
